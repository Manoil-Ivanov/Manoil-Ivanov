🚀 I'm currently navigating from Corporate Finance into the world of Cybersecurity. From crunching numbers to combating cyber threats, I’m trading balance sheets for firewalls and embracing the adrenaline-fueled world of cybersecurity — because who says finance folks can't fight hackers with the same precision they balance budgets?
